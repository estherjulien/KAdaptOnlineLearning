Experiments run for capital budgeting on 25-1-22
- on cluster for 112 instances
- some weird stuff with 32 jobs on one node, so changed it up a bit.
- NN model used: nn_class_cb_N10_K4_all_D8_W100.h5  NON BALANCED, accuracy of 0 is 0.97, of 1 around 0.4
- N_test = N_train = 10
- K_train = 4
- max_level = [5, 10, 20]
- success prediction t = 0.1, and success prediction without threshold
- MAX LEVEL 20 worked best!!
- on K_test = [3, 4, 5]
